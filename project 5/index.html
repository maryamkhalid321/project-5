        <h2> facts about cats</h2>
        <p>

               **Cats have a unique way of communicating**: They make about 100 different sounds, while dogs make only about 10¹.
             **They are excellent hunters**: When a cat chases its prey, it keeps its head level, unlike dogs and humans who bob their heads up and down¹.
             **Cats have a strong sense of balance**: They have over 30 muscles that control their ears, allowing them to rotate their ears 180 degrees².
             **They sleep a lot**: Cats spend about 70% of their lives sleeping².
             **Their noses are unique**: A cat’s nose is as unique as a human fingerprint².
             **Cats can’t taste sweetness**: Unlike dogs, cats do not have a sweet tooth due to a mutation in a key taste receptor¹.
             **They have a special way of climbing down trees**: Cats can’t climb head first down a tree because every claw on a cat’s paw points the same way. To get down from a tree, a cat must back down¹.
             **A group of cats is called a clowder**¹.
            **Cats have a healing purr**: A domestic cat’s purr has a frequency of between 25 and 150 Hertz, which is the frequency at which muscles and bones best grow and repair themselves².

        <p>Cats are fascinating creatures with several unique characteristics that set them apart from other animals:

             **Retractable Claws**: Unlike many other animals, cats have retractable claws. This allows them to keep their claws sharp for hunting and climbing while also moving silently¹.
            
            **Exceptional Flexibility**: Cats have a highly flexible spine, which enables them to twist and turn their bodies in ways that seem almost supernatural. This flexibility helps them in hunting and allows them to fit into tight spaces¹.
            
            **Night Vision**: Cats possess a structure in their eyes called the tapetum lucidum, which enhances their ability to see in low light conditions. This makes them excellent nocturnal predators¹.
            
            **Grooming Rituals**: Cats are meticulous groomers, spending hours each day cleaning their fur with their rough tongues. This behavior helps them maintain a clean and healthy coat and also serves as a way to mark their territory with their scent¹.
            
            **Kneading Behavior**: Cats often knead with their paws, a behavior believed to be a leftover instinct from kittenhood when they would knead their mother’s belly to stimulate milk production. It’s a sign of contentment and relaxation for adult cats¹.
            
            **Independent Nature**: Unlike dogs, cats are more solitary creatures. They value their personal space and independence, yet they can form deep bonds with their human companions¹.
            
            **Strong Prey Drive**: Cats have a strong hunting instinct, which is often seen in domestic cats when they chase after toys or playfully ambush their human companions¹.
